Getting started with Haiola

When you first run Haiola, it will ask you to create a new directory to store 
project information in. This should not be an existing directory, like your 
Paratext directory. Once that directory is created, you can start populating it 
with projects as explained in haiola.htm (on your local hard drive in the 
program directory or at http://haiola.org/haiola.htm).
